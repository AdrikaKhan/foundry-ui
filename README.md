# Headstorm UI

HS-UI is lovingly developed by Headstorm's Open Source group. Please reach out to us at: opensource@headstorm.com

To go directly to one of the READMES of each library, use these links:

- [hs-react-ui](https://github.com/Headstorm/hs-ui/tree/master/packages/hs-react-ui)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Headstorm/hs-ui/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Headstorm/hs-ui/tree/master)

- [hs-angular-ui](https://github.com/Headstorm/hs-ui/tree/master/packages/hs-angular-ui)

# Contributing

Find the project board which you want to contribute to. Currently there are two project boards for each front-end library included in hs-ui:

- [hs-react-ui project board](https://github.com/Headstorm/hs-ui/projects/1)
- [hs-angular-ui project board](https://github.com/Headstorm/hs-ui/projects/2)

As well as a board for overarching issues that don't belong to either package.

- [hs-ui project board](https://github.com/Headstorm/hs-ui/projects/3)

Once you're on the board for your library of choice, pick a ticket from the `Priority to do` swim-lane. **Fork and clone** the repository and create a branch for your ticket, with the ticket number prefixing the name of the ticket (i.e. `4-publish-package-to-npm`). When making commits, be sure to prefix your commit messages with the ticket number, like so: `#4 Updating package.json to make the package public`. Once you've made a commit it should automatically be moved to the `In progress` swim-lane, and then moved to `Needs review` once a PR is made.
