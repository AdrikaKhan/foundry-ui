## Intro

Foundry-UI (or Foundry for short) is a great choice for your next software project's user interface (UI), because Foundry was created to:

- Support enterprise applications at any stage, from proof-of-concept to launch to enhancements
- Allow custom styling and behavior of individual components with Foundryâ€™s unique architecture
- Reach users on any device for any use case while maintaining full functionality and accessibility

At of the time this writing, Foundry is new and launching with a fully supported React version. The Angular version is a work in progress, but don't let that stop you from reaching out about contributing on the Angular version.
